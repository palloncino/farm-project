# Pepper, Leafy Greens, and Rosemary Garden Plan

## 1. **Site Preparation**
- **Location**: Choose a sunny area (6–8 hours of sunlight/day) with well-drained soil.
- **Soil**: Ensure soil is rich in organic matter and well-draining. Ideal pH:
  - **Peppers and Leafy Greens**: 6.0–7.0.
  - **Rosemary**: 6.5–7.5.
- **Soil Enrichment**: Incorporate compost, preferably from your poultry farm, to enrich the soil.

## 2. **Garden Layout**
- **Raised Beds or Rows**:
  - **Pepper Spacing**: 30–45 cm apart in rows 60–90 cm apart.
  - **Leafy Greens**: 15–20 cm apart, with rows 30 cm apart.
  - **Rosemary**: 60–90 cm apart, since it grows into small bushes.

## 3. **Watering and Irrigation**
- **Drip Irrigation**: Install a drip irrigation system for efficient watering.
  - **Peppers and Greens**: Water 1–2 times a week, more in hot weather.
  - **Rosemary**: Water every two weeks, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.

## 4. **Companion Planting and Mulching**
- **Companion Plants**: Interplant basil, marigolds, or onions near peppers to repel pests.
- **Mulching**: Apply mulch around the plants to retain moisture and control weeds.

## 5. **Seasonal Care**
- **Peppers**: Start indoors 8–10 weeks before the last frost and transplant when soil reaches 18°C. Harvest after 60–90 days.
- **Leafy Greens**: Plant in early spring or late summer for fall harvest. Harvest outer leaves regularly.
- **Rosemary**: Perennial, requires less care but should be protected in colder climates.

## 6. **Pest and Disease Management**
- **Peppers**: Watch for aphids and bacterial spots. Use organic pest control like neem oil.
- **Leafy Greens**: Protect against slugs with row covers.
- **Rosemary**: Watch for root rot, ensure well-drained soil.

## 7. **Harvesting**
- **Peppers**: Harvest when fully sized and colored.
- **Leafy Greens**: Start picking 30–50 days after planting.
- **Rosemary**: Trim as needed for cooking.

## 8. **Cost Breakdown**
- **Soil Preparation**: €100–€300.
- **Irrigation**: €200–€400.
- **Seeds/Seedlings**:
  - **Pepper seeds/seedlings**: €10–€20.
  - **Leafy green seeds**: €5–€10.
  - **Rosemary seedlings**: €5–€15 per plant.
- **Mulch and Fertilizer**: €50–€100 (use compost from poultry to save costs).

## 9. **Sustainability Benefits**
- **Synergy with Poultry**: Use chicken manure as compost, and leafy greens can supplement poultry feed.
- **Efficient Water Use**: Drip irrigation reduces water waste.
- **Bee Pollination**: Rosemary flowers attract bees, supporting the ecosystem.
