# Land Purchase for Poultry and Honey Bee Farm

## How to Buy Agricultural Land in Italy

### 1. **Size Consideration**
- Aim for **0.5 to 1 hectare** as a minimum for poultry farming, but it's advisable to buy slightly more land to accommodate future expansion. Honey bee farming requires minimal space but benefits from larger, diverse areas for better foraging.
  
### 2. **Location**
- **Valdagno** offers suitable agricultural land, with prices starting from **â‚¬8,000 upwards** depending on size and location&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Look for land near water sources or areas with good road access to facilitate farming operations and potential sales.
  
### 3. **Legal Considerations**
- Before purchasing, obtain the **Certificate of Urban Planning (CDU)** from the municipality, which defines how the land can be used. Ensure that the land is zoned for agricultural purposes, and confirm if you can build structures like coops or beehives.
- Check if the land is subject to **pre-emption rights**, meaning neighboring farmers must be offered the land before you can purchase it&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
  
### 4. **Infrastructure**
- **Water and Electricity**: Access to clean water is critical for poultry farming and for bees during dry periods. If the land lacks utilities, plan for sustainable alternatives such as solar energy and rainwater harvesting systems.
  
### 5. **Costs and Taxes**
- Agricultural land in Italy typically involves paying a **15% stamp duty** on the purchase price. You may also face a cadastral tax (around 1% of the price) and fixed land registration fees&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
  
### 6. **Environmental Permits**
- Depending on the size and location of the land, you may require environmental permits for activities such as water use, construction, and waste management. Consult a local **Geometra** or agricultural advisor to handle documentation and compliance.
